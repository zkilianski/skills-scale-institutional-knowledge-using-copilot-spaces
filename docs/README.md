# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes are structured to provide clear guidance from project initiation through to retrospective and continuous improvement. This README provides a brief overview of our key workflows, roles, communication strategies, and quality assurance practices.

## Key Workflows

Our project management workflow follows a disciplined, five-phase lifecycle:

### 1. Project Initiation
The workflow begins with the creation of a **Project One-pager** that articulates:
- The problem statement and business need
- Project goals and objectives
- Key stakeholders and champions
- Success metrics and measurable outcomes
- High-level timeline and resource needs

This ensures all projects start with a well-defined scope and business justification before moving forward.

### 2. Planning
Once an initiative is approved, detailed planning breaks the work into manageable increments:
- Prioritized backlog with clear acceptance criteria
- Scope estimation and resource allocation
- Identification of dependencies and integration points
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Release plan and milestone mapping

### 3. Execution
The team follows a disciplined execution rhythm:
- **Project boards** visualize work states (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done)
- **Checklists and templates** standardize critical activities
- Daily standups and weekly delivery syncs maintain momentum
- Regular demos showcase progress to stakeholders
- Risk registers are updated weekly

### 4. Release & Deployment
Releases follow a structured approach:
- Pre-release requirements validation (tests, security scans, acceptance criteria)
- Deployment checklists ensure consistent execution
- Smoke tests verify functionality
- Rollback and incident playbooks provide safety nets
- Stakeholder announcements and release notes communicate changes

### 5. Retrospective & Continuous Improvement
After each sprint, release, or milestone:
- Lessons learned are captured (what went well, what could improve)
- Action items are converted to trackable backlog items
- Improvements are measured and celebrated
- The feedback loop drives ongoing process refinement

## Personas & Roles

Key personas play distinct but interconnected roles throughout the project lifecycle:

### Project Managers
- **Focus**: Coordinate timelines, risks, and communications
- **Responsibilities**: Maintain project plans, manage dependencies, facilitate meetings, ensure documentation and status reporting
- **Goals**: Deliver on time and within scope, minimize escalations, maintain transparency

### Product Managers
- **Focus**: Define product vision, prioritize the backlog, and validate solutions
- **Responsibilities**: Define problem statements and success metrics, prioritize roadmap, collaborate on trade-offs, validate with user research
- **Goals**: Maximize customer value and impact, make data-driven decisions, ensure product-market fit

### Developers
- **Focus**: Deliver reliable, maintainable code
- **Responsibilities**: Implement features meeting acceptance criteria, write tests and documentation, participate in reviews and estimation, identify technical risks
- **Goals**: Reduce cycle time, maintain high test coverage and observability

Each role is supported by defined responsibilities and communication touchpoints, ensuring alignment and transparency across functions.

## Communication Strategies

Communication is a cornerstone of OctoAcme's approach, with emphasis on regular, structured updates and rapid escalation paths:

### Regular Cadence
- **Daily standups** (15 min): focus on progress, blockers, and dependencies
- **Weekly delivery sync**: showcase progress, updates, and flagged risks
- **Weekly PM + PdM alignment**: coordinate on priorities and risks
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: keep leadership informed of progress
- **Sprint/milestone demos**: demonstrate completed work

### Status Reporting
- Single source of truth for project status (project README or release doc)
- Weekly status template includes: progress, next steps, risks & blockers, decisions needed
- Incident communication templates for rapid response
- Milestone-based updates for stakeholder groups

### Escalation Paths
Issues are triaged efficiently with clear escalation procedures:
- **Level 1**: Team-level triage in daily standup
- **Level 2**: PM escalates to Product Lead and dependent teams
- **Level 3**: Sponsor-level escalation for business-impacting issues

This structured approach enables rapid resolution while maintaining appropriate visibility.

## Quality Assurance Practices

Quality assurance is woven throughout every phase of delivery:

### Automated Testing
- **Unit tests** for new logic and core functionality
- **Integration tests** for component interactions
- **End-to-end smoke tests** for critical user flows before release
- **Security scanning** integrated into CI pipelines

### Code Quality
- Small pull requests (â‰¤400 lines when possible)
- At least one approval required before merging
- Automated linting and tests in CI
- Code review guidelines and best practices

### Deployment Safety
- Well-defined deployment and rollback checklists
- Staging environment validation before production
- Post-deployment verification procedures
- Incident response playbooks for rapid recovery

### Continuous Improvement
- Retrospectives after each sprint, release, or important milestone
- Action items tracked in project backlog with clear owners
- Impact measurement of improvement initiatives
- Culture that values feedback and psychological safety

## Key Artifacts

OctoAcme projects utilize standardized artifacts to maintain consistency:

- **Project Charter / One-pager**: initial problem and scope definition
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: strategic direction and milestones
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Risk Register**: tracked risks with mitigation plans
- **Definition of Done**: quality standards and completion criteria
- **Retrospective Notes**: lessons learned and action items
