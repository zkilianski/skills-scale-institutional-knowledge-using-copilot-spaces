## Step 3: Create an issue and pull request to improve project management processes

In this step, you will practice iterative process improvement by:

1. Creating a GitHub issue using an issue template to document needed improvements to personas/roles in project management processes
2. Using GitHub Copilot's coding agent to automatically create a pull request that implements these improvements

This demonstrates a complete improvement workflow: identify gaps (issue) ‚Üí implement solutions (pull request) ‚Üí maintain traceability (linked in Copilot Space).

### üìñ Theory: Iterative Process Improvement

Effective process evolution follows a lightweight cycle:

- Review current documentation and execution reality
- Identify gaps, ambiguities, or missing personas/roles
- Record the need as a structured issue (problem statement + rationale)
- Design and implement improvements (docs, templates, checklists) in a PR
- Communicate changes via clear descriptions and linked artifacts
- Measure adoption and revisit as new insights emerge

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the **GPT-4.1** model for all conversations with Copilot Spaces.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Attach an issue template and create an issue for process improvements

_Use the following prompt in a new Copilot Space conversation:_

- Select your repository

  > ```text
  > {{full_repo_name}}
  > ```

- Select the issue template to this new Copilot Space conversation. </br>
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/add-update-content-to-process-docs.yml`

  > Use the attached issue template
  > - Identify potential new personas/roles that could be added to the project management processes documentation
  >   to enhance clarity and accountability.
  > - Create an issue titled "Adding more personas and roles to the project management processes"
  >    that outlines the need to expand the defined roles and responsibilities in the project management documentation.
  > - Make sure the new roles/personas have descriptions of their responsibilities and how they interact with existing roles.
  > - The issue should detail why this is important, potential personas to add, and how it will improve project outcomes.
  > - add to the process document `docs/octoacme-roles-and-personas.md`

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Attach an issue and create a Pull Request

_Use the following prompt in the current Copilot Space conversation:_

In the same Copilot Space conversation do the following:

1. In this activity we will attach the issue you created in the previous activity
2. This will assign the issue to the coding agent to create a pull request with an update to our personas/roles document in the `docs/` folder
3. Copy and paste the url for the issue that we created in the previous activity. </br>

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Make sure the issue below matches the issue you want to attach
> - Hit **\<SHIFT\> + \<ENTER\>** so you don't start Copilot working on the conversation

Check issues list: [https://github.com/{{full_repo_name}}/issues](https://github.com/{{full_repo_name}}/issues) </br>

> ```text
> @{{full_repo_name}}/issues/4
> ```

1. **Allow the coding agent**: When prompted, select **Allow** to let the coding agent work on your repository

   <img width="50%" height="50%" alt="Copilot coding agent allow" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0c92c04-d12b-4c5e-b682-33643b90ee11" />

1. **Monitor progress**: You should receive a notification that the Copilot coding agent is working on your pull request. 

    There are two ways you can check the status of the coding agent working on your pull request
    
    1. Go to your repository and click **Pull requests** to see the progress:
       
       <img width="70%" height="70%" alt="pull requests" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88e9876e-2dae-43a4-86ff-29c4cdc6077c" />
  
    1. You can track progress and view details in **Mission Control** for **agent tasks** by following the task link
  
       <img width="40%" height="40%" alt="mission control" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a64c1826-720e-4b5f-8d0f-8aebc9aca501" />

1. **Check open pull requests**: We can check pull request status from our **Copilot Space** as well.

 > [!NOTE]  
 > The coding agent typically takes 5-15 minutes to complete the work. You can click **View session** to watch the progress if desired.

1. **Review and merge**: Once the pull request is ready:

   a. **Submit review**: Leave a comment (optional), click **Approve**, then **Submit review**

      <img width="70%" height="70%" alt="Add review" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea460dc3-a86d-467b-8469-bd9244b915ea" />
