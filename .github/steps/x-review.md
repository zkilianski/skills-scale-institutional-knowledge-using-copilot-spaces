Here's a recap of your accomplishments:

- **Set up a Copilot Space project management hub** by adding a repository as a source to Copilot Spaces
- **Summarize OctoAcme project management processes** by exploring and summarizing project management documentation
- **Create an issue using Copilot Spaces** to add a README for project management docs
- **Implemented improvements** by updating and adding new documentation based on your analysis
- **Experienced the full cycle** of scaling knowledge : capture, analyze, share, and  improve

You've successfully used GitHub Copilot Spaces to transform tribal knowledge into accessible, improvable documentation that your entire team can benefit from. This approach scales beyond project management to any domain where knowledge needs to be captured and shared effectively.

### What's next?

- **Scale the approach**: Apply this pattern to other areas where your team has tribal knowledge
- **Learn more about Copilot Spaces**: [GitHub Copilot Spaces Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/provide-context/use-copilot-spaces/)
- **Share with your team**: Introduce this workflow to help scale institutional knowledge across your organization
